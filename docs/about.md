# about the blog

This site was developed using Jekyll & Ruby for Github Pages. It is intended as a blog to track the progress and development of an automated stock trader.

The project root can be found at: [https://github.com/turkycat/tradingbot.git](https://github.com/turkycat/tradingbot.git)

This project will use [technical analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp) concepts and machine learning to develop a winning trading strategy that can be executed, without emotion, by software. It will contain every tool and resource used from start to finish.

This blog is intended to be useful for readers to follow along with the learning and development process.

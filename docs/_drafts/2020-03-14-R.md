### resource
youtube video on R (super old):  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_F2fcvrsw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_F2fcvrsw)  

### initial setup

Using the 5+ year old youtube video as a starting point with R, I decided to go against the actual steps he laid out, and try to set things up with the latest versions. We will see if this comes back to bite me in the ass eventually.

**R - version 3.6.3**  
https://cran.r-project.org/

**Rtools - version 35**  
https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/

**RStudio - version 1.2.5033**  
https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

In RStudio, I installed a ton of packages (using the console). I saved a script in `<root>\scratchpad\package_install.R` that I will keep up to date with the necessary packages. Run this R file and it should automatically download everything you need. The basics though, seem to be devtools and quantstrat (https://github.com/braverock/quantstrat)

##### useful commands in R

You can use `?<command>` in the console to get help on the command

```r
View(<object>)
head(<object>)
tail(<object>)
```
